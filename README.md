# 3x3 Slot Machine Simulator ðŸŽ°

## Overview
This project is a simulation of a **3x3 slot machine** game with a single payline (the middle row). The game includes **5 symbols**, including a special **Jackpot** symbol i.e. `[1,2,3,4,7]`. Players can spin the reels, bet a fixed amount per spin, and win based on symbol combinations in the middle row. The game also calculates the **Return to Player (RTP)** after each set of spins.


## Features
- **Symbols & Paylines**: 5 distinct symbols with different payout values, including a special **Jackpot** symbol.
- **Randomized Reels**: Each reel is populated with symbols based on a predefined frequency distribution.
- **Winning Conditions**:
  - A win occurs when the three symbols in the middle row match.
  - A **Jackpot win** triggers a grand payout.
  - Regular wins are based on symbol-specific payouts.
- **User-Defined Spins**: Players can choose the number of spins.
- **Return to Player (RTP)**: Calculates and displays RTP after all spins.
- **Balance Management**: The player's balance updates after each spin based on wins and spin costs.
